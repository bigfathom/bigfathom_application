This template is based on research published by Martin Seligman in his book titled 'Flourish'.  Flourishing is the goal of Positive Psychology and this template captures 
the components currently identified that contribute to such a life.  To use this template, consider what goals and tasks you can bring into your life to influence each 
of these components and then work on those.  Continuously improve in each of the areas for best results.
